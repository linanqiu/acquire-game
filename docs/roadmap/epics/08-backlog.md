# Epic 8: Backlog

## Overview

A collection of feature ideas and improvements discovered while using the app. These are not prioritized for any specific release but are captured here for future consideration.

## Purpose

- Capture feature ideas that emerge during gameplay or development
- Prevent good ideas from being lost
- Provide a pool of enhancements for future sprints

## How to Add Items

When you discover a potential improvement while using the app:

1. Create a new story file in `docs/roadmap/stories/08-backlog/`
2. Use prefix `BL-XXX` (e.g., BL-001, BL-002)
3. Set Status to `not-started`
4. Set Priority to `low` (unless clearly higher)
5. Add to the table below

## Stories

| ID | Title | Priority | Effort | Status |
|----|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| [BL-001](../stories/08-backlog/BL-001.md) | Display Other Players' Stock Holdings and Cash | low | S | not-started |
| [BL-002](../stories/08-backlog/BL-002.md) | Highlight Player's Tiles on Board | low | S | not-started |
| [BL-003](../stories/08-backlog/BL-003.md) | Fix Merger Tile Color Bug | medium | M | not-started |
| [BL-004](../stories/08-backlog/BL-004.md) | Event Log for Room Replay | low | L | not-started |
| [BL-005](../stories/08-backlog/BL-005.md) | Frontend Simplification | low | L | not-started |
| [BL-006](../stories/08-backlog/BL-006.md) | Fix 8th Chain Crash - Display Unplayable Tiles | high | M | completed |

## Promotion Process

When a backlog item is ready to be worked on:

1. Assess its dependencies on other epics
2. Move to appropriate epic if it fits, OR
3. Keep here and update priority to `high`
4. Remove from this table when completed
