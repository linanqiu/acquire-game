# BL-001: Display Other Players' Stock Holdings and Cash

## Metadata
- **Epic**: Backlog
- **Status**: `completed`
- **Priority**: `low`
- **Effort**: `S` (30-60 min)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Context

In the original Acquire board game, all players' stock holdings and cash amounts are public information. Currently our UI only shows the current player's portfolio. Players should be able to see how many stocks of each hotel chain other players own and how much cash they have.

This information is strategically important for:
- Deciding when to trigger mergers (knowing who holds majority)
- Planning stock purchases (knowing competition for bonuses)
- End-game strategy (knowing approximate scores)

## Requirements

- Display stock counts per hotel chain for each player
- Display cash amount for each player
- Information should be visible without requiring extra clicks
- Should integrate naturally with existing player cards or game UI

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each player's stock holdings are visible (count per chain)
- [ ] Each player's cash is visible
- [ ] Information updates in real-time as game state changes
- [ ] UI remains clean and scannable

## Implementation Notes

The game state already includes this information. This is primarily a UI change to expose existing data.

Consider:
- Expanding player cards to show portfolio summary
- Adding a "scoreboard" panel showing all players' positions
- Hover/tooltip on player cards for detailed view

## Verification

```bash
# Manual testing
# 1. Start a game with multiple players
# 2. Verify each player's stocks and cash are visible
# 3. Buy/sell stocks and verify counts update for all players
```
