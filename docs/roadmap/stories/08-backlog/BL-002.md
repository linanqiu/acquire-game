# BL-002: Highlight Player's Tiles on Board

## Metadata
- **Epic**: Backlog
- **Status**: `completed`
- **Priority**: `low`
- **Effort**: `S` (30-60 min)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Context

Currently, players see their available tiles in a tile rack below the board. When deciding which tile to place, players must mentally map the tile coordinates (e.g., "5C") to the board position, requiring constant visual scanning between the rack and the board.

Highlighting the player's tile positions directly on the board would make placement decisions faster and reduce cognitive load.

## Requirements

- Highlight cells on the board that correspond to tiles in the player's hand
- Highlighting should be subtle but visible (not distracting)
- Highlight should be distinguishable from other board states (empty, hotel chains, etc.)
- Should work alongside tile selection (maybe different highlight for "selected" vs "available")

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Player's available tiles are visually highlighted on the board
- [ ] Highlighting is distinct from hotel chain colors and empty cells
- [ ] Selected tile has enhanced/different highlighting
- [ ] Highlights update when tiles are played or drawn

## Implementation Notes

Possible approaches:
- Subtle border or glow on cells matching player's tiles
- Dot or marker in corner of cell
- Different background shade for playable positions

Consider color-blind accessibility when choosing highlight style.

## Verification

```bash
# Manual testing
# 1. Start a game and note tiles in hand
# 2. Verify those positions are highlighted on the board
# 3. Place a tile and verify highlight disappears
# 4. End turn, draw new tile, verify new highlight appears
```
