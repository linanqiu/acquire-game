# BL-003: Fix Merger Tile Color Bug

## Metadata
- **Epic**: Backlog
- **Status**: `not-started`
- **Priority**: `medium`
- **Effort**: `M` (1-2 hours)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Context

When hotels merge, the tile that causes the merger may remain gray (uncolored) instead of taking on the color of the surviving hotel chain. This is a visual bug that can confuse players about the actual board state.

## Requirements

- Identify root cause of merger tile not being colored
- Fix the bug so merger tiles display the correct surviving chain color
- Ensure fix works for all merger scenarios (2-way, 3-way, 4-way mergers)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Merger-triggering tile displays the surviving chain's color after merger resolves
- [ ] Works correctly for 2-chain mergers
- [ ] Works correctly for 3+ chain mergers
- [ ] Board state visually matches game engine state

## Implementation Notes

Debug steps:
1. Check if game engine correctly assigns the tile to surviving chain
2. Check if WebSocket message includes correct tile state
3. Check if frontend correctly processes tile color update
4. May be a timing issue where board renders before merger resolution completes

Likely locations:
- Backend: `game.py` merger handling
- Frontend: Board component tile rendering
- WebSocket: `game_state` message contents

## Verification

```bash
# Run scenario tests that include mergers
cd frontend && npx playwright test tests/e2e/scenarios/turn-flow.spec.ts --project=scenarios

# Manual testing
# 1. Set up a game where two chains can merge
# 2. Place the merger tile
# 3. After merger resolves, verify the tile has the surviving chain's color
```
