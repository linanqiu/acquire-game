## Stock Basics

### Stock Certificates

- Each hotel chain has **25 stock certificates**
- Total stock in the game: **175 certificates** (7 chains x 25 each)
- Stock certificates are stored in the **stock market tray** when not owned
- Stock represents ownership in a hotel chain

### Stock Value

Stock value is determined by:
1. **Chain tier**: Budget, Standard, or Premium
2. **Chain size**: Number of tiles in the chain

As chains grow larger, stock becomes more valuable.

| **Per Turn** | Maximum **3 stock certificates** total |
| **Per Chain** | May buy from one, two, or three different chains |

### Price Changes

Stock prices change when:
- A chain **grows** (new tiles added) - price may increase
- A chain **shrinks** (after merger, chain no longer exists) - N/A until re-founded

Prices do **not** change based on:
- How many stocks are sold
- Player demand
- Time in the game

---

## Stock Availability

### Total Supply

Each chain has exactly **25 stock certificates**. Once all 25 are distributed among players, no more can be purchased until stock returns to the market.

### Stock Returns to Market

Stock returns to the stock market tray when:
1. A player **sells** stock during a merger
2. The game **ends** and final accounting occurs

Stock does **NOT** return when:
- A player holds defunct stock (waiting for re-founding)
- A player trades stock (trade gives new stock, returns old)

### Checking Availability

Before purchasing, verify:
- The chain exists on the board
- Stock certificates are available in the tray
- You have enough money to pay

---

## Founder's Bonus Stock

### Free Stock on Founding

When a player founds a new chain:
- The founder receives **1 free stock certificate**
- This stock comes from the stock market tray
- No payment is required
- This does **not** count toward the 3-per-turn purchase limit

### When Bonus is Not Awarded

The founder's bonus is **not given** if:
- All 25 stocks of that chain are already owned by players
- This is rare but possible if the chain was previously founded, merged, and all stock was held

---

## Stock During Mergers

### Defunct Stock Options

When a chain becomes defunct, stockholders may:

1. **Hold**: Keep the stock (no immediate value, but may be valuable if chain re-founded)
2. **Sell**: Return to market for cash at current price
3. **Trade**: Exchange 2 defunct shares for 1 surviving chain share

### Trading Stock

**2-for-1 Trade Ratio:**
- Trade 2 defunct chain shares
- Receive 1 surviving chain share
- Only possible if surviving chain has available stock

**Example:**
- American (surviving) acquires Tower (defunct)
- You have 7 Tower shares
- Trade 6 Tower shares for 3 American shares
- Hold or sell the remaining 1 Tower share

### Stock Scarcity Strategy

During mergers, if many players want to trade:
- Surviving chain stock may run out
- First players (starting with mergemaker) have priority
- Later players may be forced to hold or sell

---

## Player-to-Player Trading

### Trading Window

Player-to-player trading can **only** occur during **Phase 1** of the active player's turn:
- Before placing a tile
- Only the active player may initiate trades
- Once tile placement begins, trading closes for the turn

### Trade Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Initiator** | Only the active player may propose trades |
| **Acceptance** | Other players may accept or decline any trade |
| **Items** | Stock certificates, cash, or combinations |
| **Frequency** | Multiple trades may occur per trading phase |
| **Timing** | Must complete before tile placement |

### Valid Trade Examples

- **Stock for stock**: 2 Tower shares for 1 Continental share
- **Stock for cash**: 3 Luxor shares for $1,500
- **Combination**: 1 American share + $500 for 2 Festival shares
- **Multi-party**: Active player may trade with different players in sequence

### Trade Strategies

**As the active player:**
- Negotiate before revealing your intended tile placement
- Trade to consolidate majority positions
- Offer premium prices for stocks you need

**As the responding player:**
- Evaluate the trade based on chain potential
- Consider why the active player wants this trade
- Remember: you can always decline
