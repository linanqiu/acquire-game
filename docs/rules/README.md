## Edition Notes

This documentation is based primarily on the classic 1999 Hasbro/Avalon Hill edition rules, which are largely consistent with the original 3M rules. Notable variations in other editions:

- **2008 Wizards of the Coast Edition**: Renamed Luxor to "Sackson" (honoring the designer); reorganized tier assignments
- **2016 Edition**: Changed safe threshold to 10 tiles; modified board to 10x10
- **Renegade Game Studios Edition**: Added "Tycoon Mode" with third-tier stockholder bonuses

For tournament play, the classic rules with 11-tile safe threshold and 12x9 board are standard.
