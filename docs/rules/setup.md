## Setup Procedure

### Step 1: Prepare the Bank

1. Select one player to act as the **Banker**
2. The Banker manages:
   - All money transactions
   - The stock market tray
   - Bonus payments during mergers
3. Place all money and stock certificates within the Banker's reach
4. The Banker may also play in the game

### Step 2: Distribute Starting Money

Each player receives **$6,000** in starting capital:

| Denomination | Quantity | Subtotal |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| $1,000 | 4 | $4,000 |
| $500 | 3 | $1,500 |
| $100 | 5 | $500 |
| **Total** | **12 bills** | **$6,000** |

Players should keep their money visible or in a manner agreed upon by all players.

### Step 3: Prepare the Tiles

1. Place all 108 tiles **face-down** in the center of the table
2. Mix the tiles thoroughly
3. The resulting pile is the **tile pool** from which players will draw

### Step 4: Determine Turn Order

1. Each player draws **one tile** from the face-down pool
2. Each player places their drawn tile on the corresponding board space
3. The player whose tile is **closest to "1A"** goes first
   - Compare by column first (lower number = closer)
   - If columns match, compare by row (earlier letter = closer)
   - Example: "2B" beats "3A"; "1C" beats "1D"
4. Play proceeds **clockwise** from the first player

**Note**: These initially placed tiles remain on the board but do **not** form chains at this time (they are "orphan" tiles).

### Step 5: Draw Starting Tiles

1. Each player draws **6 tiles** from the face-down pool
2. Players keep their tiles hidden from other players
3. Tiles should be arranged on a tile rack or held in hand
