## Pricing Formulas

For those interested in the mathematical patterns:

### Stock Price Formula
- **Base price** = Tier base ($200, $300, or $400)
- **Size increment** = $100 per size bracket
- Each size bracket adds approximately $100 to the base

### Bonus Formula
- **Majority bonus** = Stock price x 10
- **Minority bonus** = Majority bonus / 2

**Example for 5-tile Standard chain:**
- Stock price: $600
- Majority: $600 x 10 = $6,000
- Minority: $6,000 / 2 = $3,000
