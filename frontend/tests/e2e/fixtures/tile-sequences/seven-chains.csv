# Seven chains tile sequence
# This sequence is designed to create 7 separate chains on the board
#
# To found 7 chains without them merging, tiles must be placed in
# different regions of the board with sufficient gaps between them.
#
# Board layout: Columns 1-12, Rows A-I
# Strategy: Use corners and edges, spaced out
#
# Chain locations (2 tiles each, with gaps between regions):
# Chain 1: 1A, 2A (top-left)
# Chain 2: 5A, 6A (top-middle-left)
# Chain 3: 9A, 10A (top-middle-right)
# Chain 4: 1D, 2D (middle-left)
# Chain 5: 5D, 6D (middle-middle)
# Chain 6: 9D, 10D (middle-right)
# Chain 7: 1G, 2G (bottom-left)
#
# After 7 chains are founded, any tile that would create adjacency
# between non-chained tiles becomes unplayable (8th chain violation)
#
# Potential 8th chain tile: 1H adjacent to 1G could expand chain 7
# But placing a tile like 3G-4G when 3G is isolated would try to found 8th

# Additional tiles for mid-game
