# Depleted stock tile sequence
# This sequence is designed to deplete one chain's stock (25 shares)
#
# Strategy:
# 1. Human player (Player 0) founds a chain on turn 1
# 2. Human buys 3 stocks of that chain each turn
# 3. After ~8 turns: 1 (bonus) + 3*8 = 25 stocks depleted
#
# The chain tiles should be close together so human can keep
# expanding/buying without triggering mergers with other chains.
#
# Tower chain tiles concentrated in columns 1-4, rows A-D
# Other players get tiles in different areas (columns 8-12)

# Additional mid-game tiles - mostly Tower region for growth
