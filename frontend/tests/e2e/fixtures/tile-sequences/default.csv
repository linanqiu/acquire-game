# Default deterministic tile sequence for E2E tests
#
# Tile dealing in Acquire:
# - Tiles are popped from the END of the tile_bag (last = first dealt)
# - 3 players, 6 tiles each = 18 tiles dealt at game start
# - Round-robin dealing: P0, P1, P2, P0, P1, P2, ...
#
# To give Player 0 (human) tiles 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A:
# - These tiles must be at positions 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16 in the dealing order
# - Since we pop from end, they need to be at the end of the CSV
#
# Format: List tiles in order from FIRST dealt to LAST dealt
# (But since tiles are popped from end, put earliest-dealt tiles LAST in CSV)

# Remaining tiles (drawn during gameplay, listed from least to most recent)
# These will be at the front of tile_bag, drawn last
