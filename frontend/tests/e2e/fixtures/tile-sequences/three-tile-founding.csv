# Three-tile founding deterministic tile sequence
#
# Goal: Human (Player 0) founds a 3-tile chain on turn 3
# Strategy:
#   Turn 1: Human places tile-1A as orphan
#   Turn 2: Human places tile-3A as orphan with gap at tile-2A
#   Turn 3: Human places tile-2A connecting tiles 1A and 3A -> founding!
#
# Bot tiles are placed FAR from row A and FAR from each other to prevent
# any chain founding by bots.
#
# Tile dealing uses LIFO so last in CSV equals first dealt.
# Players get 6 tiles each:
#   Player 0 human gets: tile-1A tile-3A tile-2A tile-4A tile-5A tile-6A
#   Player 1 bot gets: tile-1I tile-5I tile-9I tile-1G tile-5G tile-9G spread apart
#   Player 2 bot gets: tile-3I tile-7I tile-11I tile-3G tile-7G tile-11G spread apart
#
# Board layout:
#   Column: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12
#   Row A: Human 3-tile chain at columns 1 to 3 after placing tile-2A
#   Row G: Bot tiles spread 4 columns apart for isolation
#   Row I: Bot tiles spread 4 columns apart for isolation

# Additional tiles for drawing after initial hands. Also isolated.
